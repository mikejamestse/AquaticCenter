# AquaticCenter
Web application for a fictional aquatic center. Made with Spring framework.

## Introduction
This is a five team member computer science assignment. Every member had their part to work on. For my part, I worked on the front-end of the application, using Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4, Spring Views and Controllers.

## Run the program
The easiest way is to open the application directory with a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) and run the main function. This will boot a Spring session, then you will be able to access the application on a web browser.

By default, Spring uses **localhost:8080**.

## Specifics
- Spring boot version 2.3.4
- Maven based
- Java >= 11
- JAR packaging

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot DevTools : automatic reloading after code change in development phase
- Spring Web : MVC web applications and dedicated annotations
- Spring Session : API for managing session information
- Thymeleaf : Template engine instead of jsp or jstl (subject can be changed, to be discussed during meeting)
- Spring Data JPA : persistance of data based on hibernate and spring data
- JDBC API : Database connector API that describes how client connects and query database
