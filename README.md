# AquaticCenter
Web application for a fictional aquatic center. Made with Spring framework.

## Introduction
This is a five team member computer science assignment. Every member had their part to work on. For my part, I worked on the front-end of the application, using Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4, Spring Views and Controllers.

## Run the program
The easiest way is to open the application directory with a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) and run the main function. This will boot a Spring session, then you will be able to access the application on a web browser.

By default, Spring uses **localhost:8080**.
